Some hideous kludge for importing all Flask snippets from
http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/ to the new repository at
https://github.com/pocoo/flask-snippets

  1.) Install html2rest from PyPI
  2.) Run ./fetch.sh (you need wget for this)
  3.) Run ./generate.py (Python 2)
  4.) Take a look at ./output/
